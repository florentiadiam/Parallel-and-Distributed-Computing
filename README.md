# CPD Projects

In this project, we made a Client-Server interface for a simple multiplayer game, Rock Paper Scissors. The player first has to log in, then choose between simple and rank mode, and the server adds them to a queue. When the match is over, the server prints if the player lost, won, or if it was a tie. In case the player disconnects, they could reconnect with a session token and be added to the queue again. This project was implemented with Java.
